This is a repository used to track my progression in programming Java, that will also serve as a portfolio for future endeavors.

I will first follow a 12-week program made by ChatGPT with the prompt "Hello chat! I was wondering if you would help me plan a roadmap for making a Java portfolio. I'm looking to get a job at a robotics firm that mainly uses Java and Oracle/SQL. I need to make a comprehensive portfolio during the next 12 weeks. I need to balance it with work and school. Any good project ideas?", followed by more specifications to get the little things right

This portfolio will display my progress from the very basics up to finsishing my first larger project.
